# Churn-Rate-Prediction


Introduction:
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, I focus on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, leveraging various customer-related features to improve prediction accuracy. By analyzing factors such as the age of the user, usage frequency, subscription type, contract length, and history of payment delays, I aim to build robust models that can help identify customers at risk of leaving. This approach not only helps in understanding the key drivers of churn but also enables businesses to take proactive measures to retain their customers, ultimately improving long-term profitability.
