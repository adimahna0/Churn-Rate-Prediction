# Churn-Rate-Prediction


Introduction:
Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, I focus on predicting customer churn using machine learning models, leveraging various customer-related features to improve prediction accuracy. By analyzing factors such as the age of the user, usage frequency, subscription type, contract length, and history of payment delays, I aim to build robust models that can help identify customers at risk of leaving. This approach not only helps in understanding the key drivers of churn but also enables businesses to take proactive measures to retain their customers, ultimately improving long-term profitability.



Machine Learning:
Using statistical tests and feature engineering, I formed new features based upon the initial features which demonstrated highest correlation with accurate customer churn. After adding the new features and removing the features demonstrating minimal correlation, I tested different machine learning models. The machine learning models I trained include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost Classifier.

The best model was the Gradient Boosting Classifier with 98.6% accuracy, 99.87% precision,0.976% recall, and 0.987 f1 score. 


Data Visualization:
For the data visualization files, I performed feature selection analysis through forming correlation heatmaps and huing features based on customer churn or not. Performing uni-variant analysis, discrete data distribution, multivariate, correlation analysis, I analyzed features against custonmer churn to reveal interesting information.
